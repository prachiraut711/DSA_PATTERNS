# 739. Daily Temperatures

# Hint
# Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures, return an array answer such that answer[i] is the number of days you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.

# Example 1:

# Input: temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]
# Output: [1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]
# Example 2:

# Input: temperatures = [30,40,50,60]
# Output: [1,1,1,0]
# Example 3:

# Input: temperatures = [30,60,90]
# Output: [1,1,0]
