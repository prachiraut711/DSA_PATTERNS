# 69. Sqrt(x)

# Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

# You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

# For example, do not use pow(x, 0.5) in c++ or x ** 0.5 in python.
# Example 1:
# Input: x = 4
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.

# Example 2:
# Input: x = 8
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.

# Idea

# Find integer sqrt using binary search

# 🧠 Approach
# Search in range [1, x]
# Check mid * mid
# if equal to x → return mid
# if smaller than x → move right
# else → move left
#at end return right if mid is not answer this imp 

def mySqrt(x):
    left = 1
    right = x
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2

        if mid * mid == x:
            return mid
        elif mid * mid < x:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    
    return right  #this is IMP  return right if mid is not answer this imp 

print(mySqrt(4))  #2
print(mySqrt(8))  #2
